## Architecture Diagrams (private)

While ris-adm-literature is Free and Open Source, it is part of a larger project called NeuRIS which is not entirely open source; the diagrams on how ris-adm-literature is set up and connected to the other NeuRIS components are not public either.

Internal staff and stakeholders can access the ris-adm-literature diagrams here:
