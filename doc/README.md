## Architecture Diagrams (private)
While RIS-ADM-VwV is Free and Open Source, it is part of a larger project called NeuRIS, which is not entirely open source; the diagrams on how RIS-ADM-VwV is set up and connected to the other NeuRIS components are not public either.

Internal staff and stakeholders can access the RIS-ADM-VwV diagrams here:
