# 8. Using German Domain Terms

❓❓ Date: 202x-xx-xx

## Status

❓❓ Draft (should become accepted)

## Context

[The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.]

When it comes to domain terms we have used English on the tech side of our project and German when it came to communicating within the domain.

This is a sensible default in most projects as English is most wide-spread in software engineering, but in our setting has lead to misunderstanding and additional work when translating (often: on-the-fly) between those two "worlds".

The recommendation within DigitalService is to favor keeping domain-specific terms in German over "language purity" ([source](https://digitalservicebund.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BgD4WQ)).

## Decision

❓❓ [The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement.]

We're gradually transforming our tech towards using German domain terms.

This means that:

* New domain terms will be introduced in German
* Domain terms that already exist in our solution will be replaced over time. I.e. not via in a large scale refactoring project, but in small steps whenever the current piece of work benefits from the refactoring.

## Consequences

❓❓ [What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.]
