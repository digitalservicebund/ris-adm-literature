# RIS VwV

This repository contains software tools supporting the documentation of administrative directives (DE: ‚ÄúVerwaltungsvorschriften‚Äù).

The name "RIS VwV" refers to
* "RIS", which is the German acronym for "information system on the law" (DE: "Rechtsinformationssystem")
* "VwV", which makes explicit that within RIS, we're explicitly dealing with administrative directives (and not, for example, federal laws or court verdicts)
